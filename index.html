        <h3>Object of the Game</h3>
        <p>
          The goal is to have the most discs on the board by the end of the
          game.
        </p>

        <h3>Game Play</h3>
        <p>
          Othello is a strategy board game played between 2 players. One player
          plays black and the other white.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the game alternates between white and black unless there are no
          more possible moves for the turn-taker. The player must hit PASS to
          continue the game.
        </p>
        <p>**You cannot pass if there's still a possible move!**</p>
        <p>
          If neither player can make a move, then the game ends (either when the
          board is fulled or if one player's pieces have all been turned.
        </p>
        <h3>Valid Moves</h3>
        <p>
          Possible moves will be highlighted on the board - it only shows when
          there is an opposite piece adjacent to the turn-taker's piece that can
          be connected to their own piece.
        </p>
        <p>
          A disc may flip any number of discs in one or more rows in any
          direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) so long as at the opposite
          end of the played piece, there is the turn-taker's piece to connect
          it.
        </p>
        <h3>End of the Game</h3>
        <p>
          The game ends when there are no more possible moves. The discs are
          then counted and the player with the most pieces on the board wins!
