        <h3>Object of the Game</h3>
        <p>
          The goal is to get the majority of colour discs on the board at the
          end of the game
        </p>

        <h3>Game Play</h3>
        <p>
          Othello is a strategy board game played between 2 players. One player
          plays black and the other white. Each player gets 32 discs and black
          always starts the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then the game alternates between white and black until: one player can
          not make a valid move to outflank the opponent. both players have no
          valid moves. When a player has no valid moves, he pass his turn and
          the opponent continues.
        </p>
        <p>When both players can not make a valid move the game ends.</p>
        <h3>Valid Moves</h3>
        <p>
          A move is made by placing a disc of the player's color on the board in
          a position that "out-flanks" one or more of the opponent's discs.
        </p>
        <p>
          A disc or row of discs is outflanked when it is surrounded at the ends
          by discs of the opposite color.
        </p>
        <p>
          A disc may outflank any number of discs in one or more rows in any
          direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
        </p>
        <p>
          All the discs which are outflanked will be flipped, even if it is to
          the player's advantage not to flip them. Discs may only be outflanked
          as a direct result of a move and must fall in the direct line of the
          disc being played.
        </p>
        <h3>End of the Game</h3>
        <p>
          When it is no longer possible for either player to move, the game is
          over. The discs are now counted and the player with the majority of
          his or her color discs on the board is the winner.
